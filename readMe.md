# File Upload Plugin

This plugin provides a simple, user-friendly interface for uploading files and displaying a list of uploaded files. It consists of a client-side HTML/JavaScript implementation and a server-side Node.js application.

## Features

- File selection and upload functionality
- Progress bar for upload status
- List view of uploaded files
- Error handling and success notifications

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Configuration

1. Open the `index.html` file and ensure the `API_URL` constant is set to your server's address:
   ```javascript
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';
   ```

2. Make sure you have an 'uploads' directory in the same folder as your server.js file. If not, create one:
   ```
   mkdir uploads
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser, or serve it using a local development server.
